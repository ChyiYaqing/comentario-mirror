# Comentario changelog

## v2.2.3

This release brings no extra functionality to Comentario, but rather concentrates on the automated build pipeline, stability, and [documentation](https://docs.comentario.app/).

We're now using Cypress for end-to-end (e2e) tests (the proper tests will follow).

## v2.2.2

**Changes:**

* Helm chart: add `comentario.indexHtmlConfigMapName` config value (073c0b8)
* Serve favicon at root (a56ea0f)
* Tie style to Comentario colours (e1b21f4)
* Fix: Vue error in dashboard (ac4993f)

## v2.2.1

**Changes:**

* Allow serving `index.html` at root when present (20bb3db)
* Fix: comment voting turned score into `NaN` for zero-score comment (bca19a3)
* Allow moderator edit others' comments (resolves #2) (84c5ec1)
* Allow interrupting connection process with `SIGINT` (0a0e83e, 40c13b8)

## v2.2.0

* This release features a major backend overhaul: Comentario is now using server code generated with [go-swagger](https://goswagger.io/) based on the [Swagger/OpenAPI spec](swagger/swagger.yml).
* All available federated authentication options are fully functional again: GitHub, GitLab, Google, Twitter, and SSO.
* This is the last Comentario version that's fully compatible (meaning, backward- and forward-compatible) with Commento database v1.8.0.
* It's also *almost* compatible with Commento API, with the exception that it consumes `application/json` instead of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

## v2.0.1
